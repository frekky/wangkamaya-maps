 Importing Data
 ==============

Initially designed for bulk import of GEONOMA database from CSV format. This is available in various formats via https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/geographic-names-geonoma

You need to know:
- Spatial reference / projection (SRID) of source data
- Which columns in source CSV file map to which fields in the place database
