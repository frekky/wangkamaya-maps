===================================

**All-in-one system to store and display Australian Aboriginal place-name data on an interactive online map.**

All spatial data is stored in the database using spatial reference WGS84 (SRID ESRI:4326) for compatability with the web map software.

Designed to supplement the Discovery Song Database with a focus on displaying/publishing geographical data.
